# Operator Provenance & Constraints

Required metadata
- Measurement/derivation method, devices (make/model/firmware), environment, date/time.
- Technical constraints: sample rate/bit depth/level ranges, channels.
- Author and permissions (license terms). ARR applies unless stated.

Guidance
- For LTI (IR/FIR/IIR): ensure stationarity during measurement; document levels and rates.
- For nonlinear chains: capture parameterization or provide a learned model; state applicability.
- Record determinism: specify seeds or fixed parameters for reproducible application.

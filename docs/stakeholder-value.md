# Value by Stakeholder (Plain English)

- App/Service Teams
  - Stable, cached reads of shared assets; fewer bespoke pipelines.
  - Faster deploys/rollbacks as releases reuse existing chunks.
  - Metrics: cache hit%, deployment time, egress reduced.

- ML/Data Science
  - Reproducible datasets via manifests; only deltas re-fetched.
  - Compute cache: skip repeated feature/transform steps (task keys).
  - Metrics: compute time saved, kWh/CO2e avoided, lineage clarity.

- Analytics/BI
  - Trusted, versioned data products; quicker access (self‑serve optional).
  - Less laptop/SharePoint sprawl via store‑once, fetch‑by‑hash.
  - Metrics: time‑to‑access, duplicate copies eliminated.

- Backup/DR
  - Dedup + erasure coding = less space, faster restores.
  - Metrics: storage overhead, RTO/RPO improvements.

- Media/Content Pipelines
  - Delta sync on edits; edge/LAN caches speed reviews.
  - Operator presets (IR/FIR) reapply effects identically.
  - Metrics: transfer saved per revision, render time saved.

- Procurement/Finance
  - Avoid redundant capacity (store once); defer capex for “hardware chains” via operator presets.
  - Metrics: $/TB‑month saved, egress costs, device/runtime licensing avoided.

- Security/Governance (optional layer)
  - Fewer uncontrolled copies; audit trail; strong denial via encryption when needed.
  - Metrics: sensitive copies reduced, policy exceptions, audit completeness.

- Sustainability/ESG
  - Less storage hardware, less WAN, less compute recomputation.
  - Metrics: kWh and CO2e avoided (proportional to storage/compute/WAN savings).

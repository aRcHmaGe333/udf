# Stewardship & Sustainability

This project aims to benefit everyone while remaining sustainable for its maintainers.

Ways to support:
- Sponsorships/consulting for pilots and integrations
- Priority support and roadmap input for sponsors
- Co-develop reference implementations

Governance suggestions:
- Transparent roadmap and metrics
- Clear maintainer time commitments
- Opt-in commercial support without restricting the open docs/specs

Note: Funding links can be added via `.github/FUNDING.yml` once decided.

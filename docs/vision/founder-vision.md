# UDF Founder Vision (Adapted)

Core intent
- Store bytes once as reusable chunks; reference them everywhere.
- Minimize transfers by sending only changed chunks; keep hot chunks near use.
- Make this a low-level, efficient fabric others can build on.

Why this matters
- Copies multiply across devices and systems, wasting space and bandwidth.
- Many updates are tiny; full re-downloads are wasteful.
- Even a single PC benefits: one copy of shared bytes across many files.

What UDF adds
- Content-addressed chunks (hash = identity)
- Manifests to define versions
- Delta sync for updates
- Caching for locality
- Optional governance for safety/compliance when needed

Intended outcomes
- Less storage, less egress, faster access
- Integrity by default (hash verification)
- A simple path to scale from a laptop to global distribution

# Universal Data Fabric (working title)

**Unified, content-addressed architecture for the next era in data, workloads, and devices: store once as chunks, reference everywhere, move and re-use only what changes.**

## ⚠️ Important Disclosure & Invitation

**This repository is an architectural and conceptual disclosure, not a software product or traditional open-source project.  
The code and documentation shared herein are illustrative; the true asset is a vision for scalable, universal data fabric and its global ecosystem.  
We invite inquiry, strategic dialogue, funding relationships, and coalition-building aimed at realizing this vision—  
significant organizational and financial support is required to develop it further to production or standards-grade maturity.**

- **If you are a funder, organization, domain expert, or industry leader interested in foundational infrastructure,  
  please reach out (see below) to discuss pilots, partnership, or sponsorship.**
- **Feedback on use-cases, alignment with other large-scale efforts, or broad-scope risks is welcomed via the Issues tracker or direct contact.**
- **Code/document contributions are not accepted at this time.  
  All rights are reserved except those described in the LICENSE.**

## Project Scope and Purpose

### Why this matters

Most digital infrastructure perpetuates inefficiency by duplicating data, synchronizing state redundantly, and limiting true universal interoperability of data, workloads, and hardware abstraction.

**UDF (“Universal Data Fabric”) proposes:**  
- Atomic chunking, content-addressed storage for global deduplication  
- Delta sync and decentralized, locality-aware caching  
- Deterministic, content-addressed compute at scale  
- Hardware abstraction enabling composability and cross-stack re-use  
- Optional, layered governance for federated or regulated contexts  
*(See vision and technical docs in `/docs/`—recommended starting point: `docs/start-here.md`)*

### What this repository contains
- Conceptual outlines, reference architectures, and foundational documents
- Select, illustrative code snippets and micro-demos (no production or reference software included)
- A map to key problem domains (data, compute, devices, governance, and future stack)

### What it does **NOT** contain
- No mature software, full prototype, or reference implementation  
- No open license for code or documentation re-use (see LICENSE.txt)

## Team Formation: Building the Best, Responsibly

We are committed to assembling the strongest team for Universal Data Fabric—not merely to move quickly, but to build robustly, securely, and with architectural depth. Until sustainable funding or substantial coalition support is secured, we are compiling a roster of prospective core contributors. Individuals will be formally named for future onboarding, with all actual work commencing only after resources and scope alignment are in place.

We seek to align with individuals possessing both vision and technical depth who are eager to help shape foundational infrastructure. No binding obligation or uncompensated work is expected. Instead, our aim is to transparently signal our intent to do things correctly from the outset.

**Key Provisional Roles:**
- Distributed Systems Architect
- Storage/Networking Engineer
- Data Pipeline Engineer
- Security & Governance Specialist
- Ecosystem/Standards Advisor (advisory/collaborative, outreach)

If you are interested in being named among the initial team, or wish to serve as an advisor as the project launches, please reach out. This open call demonstrates a commitment to quality and rigorous stewardship from day one.

## Who Should Engage

- **Funders, investors, infrastructure owners, and multi-sector leaders** motivated to shape next-generation data, compute, and device abstraction layers.
- **Experts in distributed systems, networking, regulated data, or hardware interfaces** seeking a foundational technical challenge.
- **Coalition-builders** (industry consortia, nonprofit, academic/standards organizations) interested in pilots, stewardship, or multidisciplinary collaboration.
- See `/docs/vision` and `docs/pilot-plan.md` for context on direction, scale, and partnership models.

## Current Status

**This project is in “disclosure and coalition-building” mode.**  
No active code engineering will begin until adequate alignment, sponsorship, and governance are established.  
Small demo snippets illustrate aspects of the architecture only.  
All partnership and collaboration inquiries are welcome: please use Issues, the FUNDING.md file, or reach out via GitHub profile (or email, if supplied).

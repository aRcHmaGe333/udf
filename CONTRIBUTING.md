# Contributing

Thanks for your interest. Contributions are paused while we finalize direction.

What weâ€™re collecting now
- Feedback via issues (use the Feedback template): use cases, unclear sections, missing edge cases, and measurable scenarios we can demo.

Why contributions will matter later
- Reference implementation: client (chunking, hashing, manifests), locator, and cache.
- Connectors and integrations: table formats, gateways (FUSE/S3), and query engines.
- Validations and benchmarks: datasets and workloads that prove dedupe/delta/cache gains.

Until contributions open
- Please do not open PRs; they will be closed. Issues for feedback are welcome.

Thanks for helping! To keep things simple:

- Small PRs welcome for typos, clarity, and examples.
- For major changes, open an issue first to discuss direction.
- Keep general-audience docs approachable; link to deep specs for details.
- Include measurements or small demos where claims are made.

Code style (examples):
- Prefer clear, minimal Python for demos.
- No external dependencies unless essential.

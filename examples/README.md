# Examples

Tiny scripts that demonstrate space and transfer savings. No external deps.

- `dedupe_demo.py`: Given files, chunks them and reports unique bytes vs total.
- `delta_demo.py`: Compares two versions and reports changed bytes.
- `cache_sim.py`: Simulates cache hit rates and WAN savings.

Data: small sample files in `examples/data/`.
